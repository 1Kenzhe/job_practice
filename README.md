2. Purpose of Potential user-service and notification-service
These are examples of common services you might add as your application grows and you embrace a microservices architecture. Their purpose is to encapsulate specific business capabilities:
user-service (User Management Microservice):
Purpose: To handle all aspects related to users of your job portal.

Responsibilities:
User Registration: Creating new user accounts (job seekers, company recruiters).
Authentication: Verifying user credentials (login). This service would likely be the authority for user identity.
Authorization: Managing user roles and permissions (though the enforcement might be done by an API Gateway or individual services based on user info).
User Profile Management: Allowing users to view and update their profiles (name, contact info, resume for job seekers, company details for recruiters if not handled by company-service).
Password Management: Securely handling password hashing, resets, changes.
Potentially user preferences, settings, etc.

Why a separate service?
User management is a distinct and often complex domain.
It can be reused by many other services that need to know about users.
Security concerns related to user data and authentication are often best isolated.
Can be scaled independently if user traffic is high.
notification-service (Notification Microservice):
Purpose: To handle sending various types of notifications to users or other systems.
Responsibilities:
Sending Emails: (e.g., welcome emails, password reset emails, new job alerts, application status updates).
Sending SMS (Optional): For critical alerts.
In-App Notifications (Optional): If your platform has a UI with a notification center.
Push Notifications (Optional): For mobile apps.
Managing notification templates.
Tracking notification delivery status.
Potentially handling user notification preferences (e.g., "email me daily about new jobs").
Why a separate service?
Decoupling: Other services (like job-service when a new job matching a user's criteria is posted, or user-service on registration) don't need to know the details of how to send an email or SMS. They just send a "notification request" to the notification-service.
Scalability: Notification sending can be resource-intensive; it can be scaled independently.
Resilience: If email sending has temporary issues, it doesn't bring down the core job application functionality. The notification-service can queue requests and retry.
Maintainability: Consolidates all notification logic in one place.
Flexibility: Easy to add new notification channels (e.g., Slack, MS Teams) without modifying other services.
How they would fit into your Job Portal:
A Job Seeker registers via the user-service.
The user-service might publish a UserRegisteredEvent to Kafka.
The notification-service consumes this event and sends a welcome email.
A Company (managed by company-service) posts a new job via the job-service.
The job-service might publish a NewJobPostedEvent.
The notification-service (or a dedicated "job-alert-service") could consume this, find users whose preferences match the new job (perhaps by querying the user-service or its own data store), and send them email/in-app notifications.
When a job seeker applies for a job, the job-service (or a new application-service) might interact with the user-service (to get applicant details) and then trigger the notification-service to inform the company.
These are just illustrative examples. The exact responsibilities and interactions depend on the specific features you want to build. The key idea is to break down your application into smaller, focused, independently deployable services that communicate with each other (often asynchronously via message queues or synchronously via REST/gRPC for specific queries).
